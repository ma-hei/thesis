\subsection{Integrating the similarity matrices}
For the MF+CCRF method that is developed in this thesis it is possible to integrate:
\begin{itemize}
\item none of the similarity matrices
\item only the drug drug similarity matrix
\item only the target target similarity matrix
\item both similarity matrices
\end{itemize}
Here, using no similarity metric means to use just the MF prediction. When only the drug-drug similarity metric is used, we build graphical models for each column of the matrix. Thus a separate set of parameters is learned and independent predictions are made for each target. Similarly, if only the target-target similarity metric is used, a separate graphical model is build for each row of the matrix and separate paratemers are learned and independant predictions made for each drug. When both similarity matrices are used each cell of the matrix becomes a node of the CCRF and by default we would learn only one set of parameters for this CCRF. The datasets that were used for the experiments in this thesis are too large to create a single graphical model for all drugs and targets because in the inference step it is necessary to compute the inverse of a matrix of size $|D||T| \times |D||T|$. In order to integrate both similarity matrices for the CCRF the drug-target matrix was clustered into smaller submatrices of feasible size.

\subsection{Parallelization}


\subsection{Graphical structure of CCRF}

As mentioned in \ref{sec:MFCCRF}, different strategies can be applied to chose the edges of the graphical model. Which of the CCRF nodes are connected is defined through the similarity matrix $S$ in the formulation of the CCRF. Theoretically, one can connect all nodes to all other nodes and weight the edges with the similarity between the corresponding drugs or targets. However, the time of computing the covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution, which is defined through the CCRF depends on the sparsity of $S$. It is necessary to compute this inverse in each step of the parameter learning as well as in the inference step. In order to get CCRFs with a feasible structure, the edges for the experiments in this thesis where chosen by connecting all drugs and targets to its $k=4$ nearest neighbors. An other strategy to connect the nodes, that was tested in this thesis is to chose a similarity-threshold $t$ and connect all drugs and targets with a similarity above the threshold.

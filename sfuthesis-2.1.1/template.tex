\section{A Statement of the Problem}

Knowledge about the interaction strength between chemical structures and proteins is an important topic in drug development.
The goal in drug development is to find a chemical structure that binds to a diseases target protein without causing harmful side effects by binding to proteins other than the diseases target.
The safest and most accurate method to gain knowledge about the interaction strength of drug candidates and target proteins is through wetlab experiments. On the other hand, wetlab experiments are costly in terms of time and money, as there are thousands of potential drug candidates. The failure of a new ligand in toxicity tests is higher than $90\%$ which is the most significant reason for the high cost of the drug development process. In drug development, drug repositioning is a technique in which known drugs and drug candidates are used to treat new diseases. Existing drugs may bind to the target protein of a disease other than the disease that the drug was originally developed for. Using an existing drug as a basis for the development of a new drug is far more likely to succeed, because the existing drug has already passed toxicity tests and its safety is known. Numerous openly accessible databases exist, listing the interaction of known compounds, which can be either already approved drugs or experimental drug candidates, against known target proteins (ChEMBL \cite{gaulton2012chembl}, DrugBank \cite{wishart2008drugbank}, KEGG\cite{kanehisa2011kegg}, SuperTarget \cite{gunther2008supertarget}, BindingDB \cite{liu2007bindingdb}). 

\section{Review of Literature}

Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques for drug development is a hot topic. In most existing methods the problem is formulated as a binary classification problem, where the drug-target pairs are treated as instances and the chemical structures of drugs and the amino acid subsequences of the targets can be used as features, describing the instances. The goal in the binary formulation is to classify a given drug-target pair into binding and non binding.

Two existing methods for drug target interaction prediction that are not based on machine learning techniques are docking simulation and ligand-based approaches. In docking simulation the interaction strength of ligands and proteins is estimated based on the structure of the target protein. This process is extremely time-consuming and the structural information of a protein is not always available \cite{liu2016neighborhood}. In ligand based approaches, the interaction strength of a candidate ligand to a target protein is obtained by comparing the candiate ligand to ligands for which the interaction strength to the target is known. This approach is not applicable, when information of candidate-similar ligands is not available for the target protein.

\chapter{Method}

\section{Model description}
The model that is developed in this thesis consists of two parts. As a first step, Matrix Factorization is applied to make a first prediction on the missing drug target pairs. Matrix Factorization predicts the missing values based only on the observations in the training dataset and does not take additional features of the drugs and targets into account. This is where the second part of the model, Continuous Conditional Random Fields comes into play. The Continuous Conditional Random Field gets the similarity matrices of the drugs and targets as input, together with the training dataset and the predictions that were made by Matrix Factorization on the training dataset. The intuition behind the CCRF is then to first learn:
\begin{itemize}
\item how \textit{trust-worthy} the MF prediction is (based on the MF predictions that were made on the test data)
\item how similar in terms of binding behaviour, similar drugs and similar targets (similar meaning, high similarity values are given in the similarity matrices) are.
\end{itemize}

The \textit{trust-worthyness} of the MF prediction and the agreement of binding behaviour with similarity of the drugs/targets correspond to parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the formulation of the CCRF. With the learned parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ the CCRF predicts the missing values based on the MF predictions that were made on the missing values and by interpolating between similar drugs/targets. Details of both MF and the CCRF are given in the following sections. The main focus of the developed method in this thesis is on the CCRF part. The model is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline} as a pipeline.

\subsection{Matrix Factorization}

The Matrix Factorization technique has been demonstrated to be effective specially for personalized recommendation tasks \cite{Koren:2009:MFT:1608565.1608614} and it has been previously applied for drug target interaction prediction (\cite{liu2016neighborhood}, \cite{ezzat2016drug}, \cite{gonen2013kernelized}). In general, Matrix Factorization is a process in which a sparsely filled training matrix $R$ is approximated by the product of two factor matrices $P \in \mathbb{R}^{k\times m}$ and $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{k\times n}$. In the given problem, the given values in $R$ are the experimentally validated drug-target interaction strengths and the task is to predict the missing values in the matrix. With learned matrices $P$ and $Q$, a missing affinity of drug-target pair $(d_i, t_j)$ in $R$ can be predicted by the inner product of column $i$th of $P$ and the $j$th column of $Q$.
The factor matrices $P$ and $Q$ are learned by minimizing the regularized squared error on the set of known affinities:
\begin{center}
$\min\limits_{Q,P}{\sum\limits_{(d_i,t_j)\in \kappa} (a_{i,j}-q_i^Tp_j)^2} + \lambda (||p||^2 + ||q||^2)$
\end{center}
where $\kappa$ is the set of drug-target pairs $(d_i,t_j)$ for which the binding affinity is known. The above optimization problem can be solved by stochastic gradient descent as described in \cite{Koren:2009:MFT:1608565.1608614}.

For the experiments in this thesis the LIBMF package was used in R \cite{chin2016libmf}.

\section{Proof of Concept}
This section serves as a proof of concept for the model that is developed in this thesis. In a first step, a matrix of $n$ rows and $m$ columns is generated which is then partitioned into training and test data. The matrix values are generated, such that:

\begin{itemize}
\item the dataset has underlying latent factors
\item there are certain pairs of columns in the generated dataset, s.th. the pairs of columns have similar values (simulating similar targets).
\end{itemize}

In a second step, a fraction of observations in this generated dataset are masked as test data. The remaining values are used as training data for the MF+CCRF model. The models parameters are trained based on the training data and in the next step the values that were previously masked as test data are predicted. Finally, the performance of this model is evaluated in terms of RMSE and compared to the performance of using only MF or only CCRF.
In the following, each of these steps is documented, starting with the simulation of the data.

\subsection{Data Simulation}
%\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{num_lf_mat.png}

A dataset of dimension $m \times n$ ($m$ drugs and $n$ targets) that has underlying latent factors and column-pairs with similar values can be simulating by taking a sample from the distribution that is defined by the CCRF. At first, a matrix $X$ of size $m \times n$ is generated which has only underlying latent factors as shown in figure \ref{fig:numX}. Next, the graphical structure of the CCRF is defined by arbitrarily choosing pairs of columns for which the CCRF distribution should produce similar values. In the CCRF formulation each matrix cell is a node and each node can be adjacent to any other node in the graphical model. Therefore the graphical structure of the CCRF is defined by an adjacency matrix $B$ of size $mn \times mn$. Figure \ref{fig:numStructure} shows an example of a choice of structure for the CCRF.  The values in matrix $X$ are used as node input for the CRF. Next $\alpha$ (importance of the node values) and $\beta$ (importance of the adjacency matrix) are chosen arbitrarily and a sample from the multivariate gaussian distribution that can be derived from the CCRF formulation is taken. This sample is used the dataset for the numerical experiments. It has both underlying latent factors and the assumption that \textit{similar targets} (which were chosen arbitrarily by defining the matrix $B$) have similar values is fulfilled. Figure \ref{fig:numSample} shows an example of a sample, taken from the multivariate gaussian that is defined by the CCRF where the structure of the model was chosen as described in Figure \ref{fig:numStructure}.

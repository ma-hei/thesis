\begin{abstract}
Knowledge about the interaction between drugs and target proteins is essential in the drug discovery process.
Understanding the relationship between compounds and proteins through wetlab experiments alone is time-consuming and costly. With the motivation to support the experimental work by systematically prioritizing the most potent compounds for a target, numerous methods for the in-silico prediction of drug-target interaction have been proposed recently and high performance on binary datasets, where drug-target pairs are classified as either binding or non-binding have been reported. A possible drawback of binary datasets is that missing values and non interacting drug-target pairs are not differentiated. In this thesis, a model is developed that predicts the binding strengths of drug-target pairs as continuous values and thus incorporates the whole interaction spectrum from true negative to true positive interactions in the learning phase. The developed model combines two previously used approaches for the drug-target problem, which are Matrix Factorization and Conditional Random Fields. The model is evaluated in terms of the metrics $AUC$, $AUPR$ and $CI$ on three datasets and a slight improvement in performance is observered when compared to the state of the art method.

In this study we present a new method for the prediction of continuous drug target interaction values which outperforms the state of the art method $KronRL$ on all datasets. We observe the highest performance gain in terms of $AUPR$ and $CI$ and $RMSE$, while the $AUC$ metric is very similar. Even with the assignment of the confidence score our method performs comaparably well to $KronRLS$.

In regard to the classification metrics $AUPR$ and $AUC$ it is noteworthy that our method outperforms $KronRLS$, even if $KronRLS$ learns on the binary data (binary $KronRLS$).
